# The Price - PyQt5 project
## Purpose:
This is an app that allows its user to add prices of items to a data file(csv file). The user can then check for the prices of the items at any time. No need to keep the prices of items off-head. This would be helpful to those who own shops.

### Why I did this project?
Second project I did after I studies PyQt5. It made me understand deeper, how to use the PyQt5 package.
